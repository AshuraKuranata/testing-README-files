## THE CONCEPT

We met together as a group to discuss the options of whta we wanted to create for this first game.  Our team member had a good idea for a cyber-punk/dungeons & dragons style game.

We began the process by seeing what developed lines of code they had created:

``` JavaScript below:
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();

console.log('What do you wish to be called?\n')
const username = prompt('Sign here & sell your soul: ');
console.log(`\nMany warm greetings to you, ${username}! The road ahead looks hard won to travel.`);
console.log('\nChoose your faction!\n');

let charaFaction = `
    |NETRUNNER| Masters of the digital world.\n
    |ROGUE| Merceneries for hire.\n
    |CORPORATE SPY| The deal makers behind the curtians.\n
    |NOMAD| Roaming scavengers.\n
    |MAGE| Weave spells and potions in the streets.\n
`;

let chara = {
    name : `${username}`,
    health: 100,
    sanity: 100,
    strength: 10,
    intelligence: 10,
    dexterity: 10,
    constitution: 10,
    wisdom: 10,
    charisma: 10,
};

//figured out that we needed to put the codes below, above the switch case code in order for it to work properly on the terminal.
console.log(charaFaction);
const choiceFaction = prompt('Your choice: ');

switch(choiceFaction) {
    case 'Netrunner', 'netrunner':
        console.log("\nYou've chosen to be a Netrunner. \nDigital realms bend to your will, but beware the dangers lurking in the code.\n");
        
        break;
    case 'Rogue', 'rogue':
        console.log("\nYou've chosen to be a Rogue. \nSteel, neon, and blood â€” the city pays you to stay in the shadows.\n");
        
        break;
    case 'Mage', 'mage':
        console.log("\nYou've chosen to be a Mage. \nThe magic of the old world clashes with the tech of the new. You are the bridge between the two.\n");
        
        break;
    case 'Nomad', 'nomad':
        console.log("\nYou've chose to be a Nomad. \nThe wastelands are your home, but the city calls with its neon lights and promises.\n");
        
        break;
    case 'Corporate Spy', 'Spy', 'corporate spy', 'spy':
        console.log("\nYou've chosen The Corporate Spy. \nYou move in shadows, paid in secrets, manipulating the power players of the world.\n");
        
        break;
    default:
        console.log("\nERROR 404: Access denied. \nThe neon lights flicker in aticipation and The Darkness is closing in on you.\n");
        break;
};
/*tried using for else was problibatic. I needed a code that I can put multipule layers of
 user input that mean the same thing. As much as I love for else, you can also add so many things
to each characteristic.*/

let gameOver = false

 function checkGameOver() {
     if (chara.health <= 0) {
         console.log('As The Darkness closes in around you, your blood pools around you.'); 
        console.log('\nYou start feeling colder as time passes and every body part goes numb.'); 
        console.log('\nGAME OVER flashes before your eyes one last time before The Darkness takes over.');
     } else (chara.sanity <= 0) {
         console.log('The Darkness has closed in around you. \nYou are no longer in control of your body.');
         console.log('\nYou may only watch as the whispers become the screams of the people near by.');
         console.log(' \nYou can only watch as The Darkness takes over your body and tears througoh teh city you have grown to love.');
       } 
     gameOver = true
     process.exit();
 };
 console.log(`${username}\n |HEALTH| ${chara.health}\n |SANITY| ${chara.sanity}\n |WISDOM| ${chara.wisdom}\n |INTELLIGENCE| ${chara.intelligence}\n |CONSTITUTION| ${chara.constitution}\n |STRENGTH| ${chara.strength}\n |DEXTERITY| ${chara.dexterity}\n |CHARISMA| ${chara.charisma}`);




console.log("This is part of an going project. Stay alive and stay tuned for more coming soon...")
```

We took a look over the code base and thought it was a good start to work through!

###  FIRST STEPS

From here, we decided that the first iterations we'd take on this is to make the process for the start of the game in character creation to make the faction choice.

We ran into a number of bugs and issues as we were working through this code, especially on how to utilize the 'switch - case' logic:

``` JavaScript
let chara = {
    name: `${username}`,
    faction: `${choiceFaction}`,
    health: 100,
    sanity: 100,
    strength: 10,
    intelligence: 10,
    dexterity: 10,
    constitution: 10,
    wisdom: 10,
    charisma: 10,
};

switch(choiceFaction) {
    case 'Netrunner', 'netrunner':
        console.log("\nYou've chosen to be a Netrunner. \nDigital realms bend to your will, but beware the dangers lurking in the code.\n");
        chara.heath = 70,
        chara.sanity = 90,
        chara.intelligence = 15,
        chara.dexterity = 12,
        chara.constitution = 8
        break;
}
```

The two bugs we encountered here were:
1. How to make the input from the player enter properly hit the case correctly
2. After the input was successful, how to make the input from the player capitalize properly into the 'chara' object

We tried various bug fixes, like:

``` Javascript
switch(choiceFaction) {
    case 'Netrunner' || 'netrunner':
}

switch(choiceFaction) {
    case 'Netrunner':
    case 'netrunner':
}
```

The first not working as intended and only returning the last value, and the second, while working as intended, required us to increase the lines of code and also required a specific input from the players.

The solution that one of our team members came up with was:

``` Javascript
let chara = {
    name: `${username}`,
    faction: `${choiceFaction.toUpperCase()}`,
    health: 100,
    sanity: 100,
    strength: 10,
    intelligence: 10,
    dexterity: 10,
    constitution: 10,
    wisdom: 10,
    charisma: 10,
};
switch(choiceFaction.toLowerCase(choiceFaction)) {
    case 'netrunner':
        console.log("\nYou've chosen to be a Netrunner. \nDigital realms bend to your will, but beware the dangers lurking in the code.\n");
        chara.heath = 70,
        chara.sanity = 90,
        chara.intelligence = 15,
        chara.dexterity = 12,
        chara.constitution = 8
        break
}
```

This solution allows the player to input any properly spelled version of the accepted name of each class, which solved our issues with player input & also updated the faction listed to upper case, so it would print out properly like this:

``` javascript
John
 MAGE // Input was 'mAgE' and prints correctly 
 |HEALTH| 50
 |SANITY| 100
 |WISDOM| 15
 |INTELLIGENCE| 20
 |CONSTITUTION| 10
 |STRENGTH| 10
 |DEXTERITY| 10
 |CHARISMA| 10
```

This was our first major update.
